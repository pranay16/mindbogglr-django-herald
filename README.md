Django library for separating the message content from transmission method

# Installation

1. `pip install django-herald`
2. Add `herald` and `django.contrib.sites` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
3. Add herald's URLS:

        if settings.DEBUG:
            urlpatterns = [
                url(r'^herald/', include('herald.urls')),
            ] + urlpatterns

# Usage

1. Create a `notifications.py` file in any django app. This is where your notification classes will live. Add a class like this:

        from herald import registry
        from herald.base import EmailNotification


        class WelcomeEmail(EmailNotification):  # extend from EmailNotification for emails
           template_name = 'welcome_email'  # name of template, without extension
           subject = 'Welcome'  # subject of email

           def __init__(self, user):  # optionally customize the initialization
               self.context = {'user': user}  # set context for the template rendering
               self.to_emails = [user.email]  # set list of emails to send to

           @staticmethod
           def get_demo_args():  # define a static method to return list of args needed to initialize class for testing
               from users.models import User
               return [User.objects.order_by('?')[0]]

        registry.register(WelcomeEmail)  # finally, register your notification class

2. Create templates for rendering the email using this file structure:

        templates/
            herald/
                text/
                    welcome_email.txt
                html/
                    welcome_email.html

3. Test how your email looks by navigating to `/herald/`.

4. Send your email wherever you need in your code:

        WelcomeEmail(user).send()

5. View the sent emails in django admin and even be able to resend it.


## Deleting Old Notifications

The `delnotifs` command is useful for purging the notification history.

The default usage will delete everything from sent during today:

    python manage.py delnotifs

However, you can also pass arguments for `start` or `end` dates. `end` is up to, but not including that date.

    python manage.py delnotifs --start='2016-01-01' --end='2016-01-10'



## Asynchronous Email Sending

If you are sending slightly different emails to a large number of people, it might take quite a while to process. By default, Django will process this all synchronously. For asynchronous support, we recommend django-celery-email. It is very straightfoward to setup and integrate: https://github.com/pmclanahan/django-celery-email
